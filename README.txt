These are my personal SPEC files I created for a few packages I needed on
Fedora. I know most of these programs are available on third party
repositories, and are probably way better packaged there, but I always prefer
to package the missing bits myself. If you find them useful somehow, let me
tell you all of them are released under the terms of the CC0 license. See the
COPYING file for more details.
