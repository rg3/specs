These are my personal SPEC files for a few packages I needed on Fedora. I know
most of these programs are available on third party repositories, and are
probably way better packaged there, but I always prefer to package the missing
bits myself. If you find them useful somehow, observe all of them are released
under the terms of the CC0 license. See the COPYING file for more details.
